**Commercial License Agreement â€“ Anchor4J**

This agreement governs use of the commercial edition of Anchor4J.

1. License Grant  
   Subject to payment of the applicable fees, 9187219 Canada Inc. grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable
   license to use, copy, and modify the Software for any supported Java Development Kit (JDK) version,
   including older versions such as JDK 17.

   This license is required if:

   - You compile, run, or distribute the Software on any JDK version other than the latest GA release.
   - Your organization has more than 10 employees.
   - You intend to white-label, rebrand, or distribute the Software without attribution.

2. License Scope  
   The standard license fee is $10 USD per concurrently active user per month.
   Licenses are assigned on a floating basis: any number of users may be assigned to a license pool,
   but no more than the number of purchased licenses may be used concurrently.
   This license covers use on older JDK versions and by organizations with more than 10 employees.

   This standard license does not include rights to white-label or rebrand the Software. White-labeling
   requires a separate commercial agreement with explicit written permission.

3. Support Term
   You are entitled to receive support services from 9187219 Canada Inc. for a period of one (1) year from the
   date your license fees were last paid in full. Support includes bug fixes, updates, and technical
   assistance as described in the separate [support policy](support-policy.md). Support does not include
   implementation of new features or custom development requests. Continued support beyond this period
   requires renewal of the license fees.

4. Restrictions
   You may not:
   - Remove or alter any license notices, attributions, or embedded watermarks in the Software.
   - White-label or represent the Software as your own without prior written approval.

5. Redistribution of Modified Versions  
   You may distribute modified versions of the Software only if all original license terms and notices are
   preserved. Redistributions must comply with all original license conditions, including usage restrictions,
   attribution requirements, and organizational eligibility.

6. Termination
   This license may be terminated if you breach its terms or fail to pay license fees.
