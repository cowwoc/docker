[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-A345D5.svg)](docs/changelog.md)

A modern Java client for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): fluent API, test-friendly, and Kubernetes-ready (no Docker required).

âœ… A fluent, strongly typed API.<br>
âœ… Built-in support for image build, pull and run with and without Docker Engine.<br>
âœ… Easy integration with CI and tests.<br>
âœ… First-class support for capturing stdout/stderr and process exit status.<br>

To get started, add this Maven dependency:

```xml

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.cowwoc.anchor4j</groupId>
	<artifactId>anchor4j</artifactId>
	<version>0.10</version>
</dependency>
```

## Example

```java
import com.github.cowwoc.anchor4j.docker.client.Docker;

import java.io.IOException;

class Example
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
		throws IOException, InterruptedException
	{
		Docker docker = Docker.connect();

		String imageId = docker.buildImage().
			platform("linux/amd64").
			export(Exporter.dockerImage().build()).
			build(".");

		docker.tagImage(id, "rocket-ship");
		docker.pushImage("rocket-ship").push();
	}
}
```

If you find this project helpful, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/cowwoc).
Maintaining quality open-source software takes significant time and effortâ€”especially while balancing family
life with young children. Your support helps make this work sustainable.

## Missing Features?

The `anchor4j` API covers a wide range of functionality, and since my time is limited, new features are added
based on user requests. If there's a property or capability you'd like to see added,
please [open a new issue](issues/new).
